## About

FCC Software provides a set of software packages, tools, and standards to help
different FCC physics efforts work together. The software ecosystem of the FCC
fully employs <a href="https://key4hep.github.io/key4hep-doc/">Key4hep</a>
stack and is one of its main stakeholders.


## Signpost

The FCC Software ecosystem spans many sites, repositories and packages. The
list of links bellow tries to offer a starting point.

All developments happen in
[github.com/HEP-FCC](https://github.com/HEP-FCC">github.com/HEP-FCC) and
[github.com/key4hep](https://github.com/key4hep">github.com/key4hep).
The best place to check for detailed information on a specific package thus is
  usually its homepage / Github repository page.
