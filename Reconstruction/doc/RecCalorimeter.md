Information about calorimeter reconstruction software within FCCSW. The software is being tested using ECAL, but should be general enough to be used for other calorimeters. Let us know if you have any problems or questions (Jana Faltova, Anna Zaborowska).

# Detector description

ECAL calorimeter description in `Detector/DetFCChhECalSimple`:

* Tube geometry with alternating layers of active and passive material
* Using phi-eta segmentation with offset (Note: negative eta/phi identifiers not allowed!)
* Calorimeter cells defined by a layer in R + phi-eta segment

# Digitisation

Digitisation creates cells out of simulated energy deposits. From the EDM point of view, both input and output of the digitisation uses `fcc::CaloHit`.
The input (simulated deposits) contains raw information about the energy deposited in the cells of the sensitive volumes.
The output (cells) may contain energy (corrected for the losses in the passive layers) and the noise. The calibration and noise tools could be switched on/off by setting the appropriate flags in your script. The cells may correspond to the active volumes or to the segmentation cells. In particular, different segmentation may be used than the original cells of the sensitive volumes used in the simulation.

> Note: resegmentation procedures (`RedoSegmentation`) expect the truth position of the energy deposits, hence they require `fcc::PositionedCaloHit` collection.

`CreateCaloCells` is an algorithm for the digitisation. It calls tools to perform the energy calibration and cell noise addition. It is geometry agnostic and can be used to merge any calorimeter hit collection (unless the noise is added, [see 3.](3-noise-addition)).

## 1. Energy deposits merging

The output of the simulation contains a large collection of energy deposits. First step towards the digitisation is merging those hits into the hit collection with one hit per cell of the sensitive volume. The energy of such hit is a sum of all the deposits within that sensitive volume cell.
`CreateCaloCells` does not take time into account at the moment. It is possible to add a time threshold within the current implementation (i.e. do not add energy deposits coming from delayed neutrons' energy deposits above a certain time threshold). For any more complicated digitisation, new digitisation algorithm should be developed.

> Note: Energy deposits may be merged by Sensitive Detector implementation (`AggregateCalorimeterSD`), however it is not encouraged due to the time performance issues.

## 2. Energy calibration

Energy calibration is done for sampling calorimeters to compensate for the energy deposited in the passive material.

`CalibrateCaloHitsTool`: Calibrate Geant4 energy to electromagnetic (EM) scale. The calibration constant (inverse sampling fraction) is a configurable parameter of this tool.

## 3. Noise addition

Noise is added to all cells, not only those with signal. Hence a list of all existing in the geometry cell IDs is needed and it is retrieved from the geometry. This is the only part which is geometry dependent.

Such a list is provided by a Gaudi tool deriving from `ICalorimeterTool`. Currently there are two implementations: `TubeLayerPhiEtaCaloTool` and `NestedVolumesCaloTool`. For other detector geometries additional dedicated tools could be implemented.

### ECal geometry

`TubeLayerPhiEtaCaloTool` is used for detectors like simple ECal. It expects cylindrical layers of active volume and phi-eta segmentation. Phi-eta segmentation is required to be such that all eta/phi identifiers are non-negative (to do so, use segmentation offsets). The number of cells is calculated taking each active layer and checking how many phi and eta bins exist (number of phi bins is the same for all layers). The number of all active layers is searched in the geometry by given name.
> Note. Temporarily it is possible to use MergeLayer algorithm which does decrease the total number of existing layers (in cell IDs) without changing the geometry. Hence it is necessary to specify how many active volumes exist (disabling the look-up of active layers in geometry).

### HCal geometry

The second implementation (`NestedVolumesCaloTool`) may be used if no segmentation is used. In this case only volume IDs are used and the total number of active volumes taken from geometry is also the total number of cells. In particular, if active volumes are nested, this tool finds the correct identifiers of all volumes.

Once the total number of cells and their IDs are extracted, the noise is added. The noise tools derive from `INoiseCaloCellsTool`, with two existing implementations:

 `NoiseCaloCellsFlatTool`: Adding noise assuming Gaussian distribution (with sigma '\b cellNoise'), the same distribution for all cells

 `NoiseCaloCellsFromFileTool`: Adding Gaussian noise assuming different noise levels in different cells. The noise is defined in a ROOT file and it is presented by TH1F histograms showing cell noise as a function of abs(eta). There are two sets of histograms - one with the electronics noise and the second one with the pileup contribution. It is expected that there is a separate histogram for each radial level. See the code for details [here](../RecCalorimeter/src/components/NoiseCaloCellsFromFileTool.cpp).

# Reconstruction

Reconstruction creates clusters (`fcc::CaloCluster`) out of cells (`fcc::CaloHit`). Each cluster stores the information about its global position (x, y, z), energy and the relation to the cells it is composed of.

## Sliding window algorithm

Sliding window algorithm is an algorithm used for the reconstruction of electrons and photons. The algorithm is the same one as used by the ATLAS experiment ( [link](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1099735?ln=de) ).

`CreateCaloClustersSlidingWindow` implementation operates on towers in phi-eta space, hence it requires the cells to have eta-phi segmentation.

> Note: If this segmentation was not used for the original simulation and the true deposits' positions are saved (`fcc::PositionedCaloHit`, it is possible to re-segment using `RedoSegmentation` algorithm.

All operations on cell collection from calorimeter are defined in a tool derived from `ITowerTool`. Currently there are two implementations of that tool: `SingleCaloTowerTool` used for one cell collection and `CombinedCaloTowerTool` used for two cell collections.

### 1. Create calorimeter towers.

Calorimeter towers are created by a tool deriving from `ITowerTool`. That is where the size of the tower is defined. A tower contains all cells within certain eta and phi (tower size: **deltaEtaTower**, **deltaPhiTower**). Distance in r plays no role in this algorithm. However, the final clusters contain position in Cartesian coordinates, hence some radius needs to be defined (**radiusForPosition**) allowing (eta, phi, r) transformation to (x, y, z). By default it is set to 1.

The first step is to define the number of towers in eta and phi. The latter is calculated from the full azimuthal angle (2pi) and the size of the tower in phi.
The number of towers in eta is calculated from detector's maximum eta and the tower size in eta. Maximum eta should be defined by in job options (**maxEta**). If it is undefined, the number of towers in eta is recalculated for each event, by searching for the highest (absolute) value of pseudorapidity. This approach may be used in tests or to determine what is the maximum eta of the detector. It is highly advised that in production **maxEta** is defined, as it can take even ~10 seconds per event to loop over cells collection (or up to 35\% of sliding window algorithm runtime) - determined with existing test cases.

The next step is to loop over all cells and add the cell transverse energy to the tower(s) that cells belongs to.

### 2. Find local maxima.

Local maxima are found using the sliding window of a fixed size in eta x phi (**nEtaWindow** **nPhiWindow** in units of tower size). If a local max is found and its energy is above threshold (**energyThreshold**), it is added to the preclusters list. Each precluster contains the barycentre position and the transverse energy. Position is recalculated using the window size in eta x phi (**nEtaPosition**, **nPhiPosition**) that may be smaller than the sliding window to reduce the noise influence. Both windows are centered at the same tower. The energy of the precluster also needs recalculation and is done using the final cluster window (**nEtaFinal**, **nPhiFinal**). The precluster is created if that energy is still above the threshold.

### 3. Remove duplicates.

If two pre-clusters are found next to each other (within window **nEtaDuplicates**, **nPhiDuplicates**), the pre-cluster with lower energy is removed.

### 4. Build clusters.

Clusters are created using the pre-clusters energy (energy of towers within the sliding window). Position is calculated from the barycentre position and the inner radius of the detector. Energy sharing between final clusters is implemented (if the flag energySharingCorrection set to true - default). For each cluster the cell collection is searched and all those inside the cluster are attached.

# Example

Example script which runs ECAL reconstruction can be found for three cases: [without noise](../RecCalorimeter/tests/options/runEcalReconstructionWithotNoise.py), [with same Gaussian noise for all cells](../RecCalorimeter/tests/options/runEcalReconstructionFlatNoise.py), [with noise from file](../RecCalorimeter/tests/options/runEcalReconstruction.py).

* Read input file with Geant4 hits
* Produce and store calo cells (CreateCaloCells)
* Reconstruct clusters using the sliding window algorithm (CreateCaloClustersSlidingWindow)

First, prepare the input file. Before running the script, load the library libDetSegmentation.so (necessary because of the phi-eta segmentation usage):
~~~{.sh}
./run gaudirun.py Reconstruction/RecCalorimeter/tests/options/geant_fullsim_ecal_singleparticles.py
~~~

Now, we can run the reconstruction:
~~~{.sh}
./run gaudirun.py Reconstruction/RecCalorimeter/tests/options/runEcalReconstructionWithoutNoise.py
./run gaudirun.py Reconstruction/RecCalorimeter/tests/options/runEcalReconstructionFlatNoise.py
./run gaudirun.py Reconstruction/RecCalorimeter/tests/options/runEcalReconstruction.py
~~~
