! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run.
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive  -  but spellings-sensitive!
! The settings here are illustrative, not always physics-motivated.

! 1) Settings used in the main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 1000         ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 3          ! how many aborts before run stops

! 2) Settings related to output in init(), next() and stat().
Init:showChangedSettings = on      ! list changed settings
Init:showChangedParticleData = off ! list changed particle data
Next:numberCount = 100             ! print message every n events
Next:numberShowInfo = 1            ! print event information n times
Next:numberShowProcess = 1         ! print process record n times
Next:numberShowEvent = 0           ! print event record n times

! 3) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 11                   ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = -11                   ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212


! 4) Hard process : ZH, Z->mumu, H->bb, at 240 GeV

Beams:eCM = 240.                 ! CM energy of collision

HiggsSM:ffbar2HZ = on
23:onMode = off
23:onIfMatch = 13 13
25:onMode = off
25:onIfMatch = 5 5

! 6) Random generator
Random:setSeed = on                ! apply user-set seed everytime the Pythia::init is called
Random:seed    = 0                 ! -1=default seed, 0=seed based on time, >0 user seed number
