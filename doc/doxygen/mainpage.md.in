FCCSW Documentation {#mainpage}
==

This is the automatically generated documentation of the FCCSW framework, the software for the FCC experiments.

FCCSW is based on [Gaudi](http://proj-gaudi.web.cern.ch/proj-gaudi/). We aim to support all detector concepts for all
accelerator options (electron-electron, electron-hadron and hadron-hadron). Therefore, we try to create software that is
independent of detector or experiment specifics.

**The main hub for documentation of our different software packages can be found [here](http://fccsw.web.cern.ch/fccsw/).**

If you need support, contact us via

- the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/fccsw/issues) (for bugs and problems)
- our mailing list (for questions): fcc-experiments-sw-dev at cern.ch

If you plan to contribute to FCCSW, please have a look at our [contribution guide](http://fccsw.web.cern.ch/fccsw/tutorials/fcc-tutorials/FccSoftwareGit.html).

Installation instructions can be found in the [README](http://fccsw.web.cern.ch/fccsw/tutorials/FCCSW/README.html).
