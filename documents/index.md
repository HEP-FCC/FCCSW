## Feasibility Study Report

TBA

## Conceptual Design Report

The [summary volumes](https://fcc-cdr.web.cern.ch/) have been released, with many
physics and detector simulations carried out using FCCSW. We collaborated with
CERN's [Re-usable Analysis](https://www.reanahub.io/) working group to make the
workflows used in the CDR reproducible and accessible for future studies.
[Here](https://github.com/reanahub/reana-demo-fcchh-fullsim) is a first example
of a full-simulation workflow.


## Past Publications and Presentations

Besides the contributions included in the Feasibility Study report and
Conceptual Design report, there were numerous software sessions at FCC
conferences and related workshops. The following list is very incomplete, please
submit other contributions to be included here by creating an issue on
[Github](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/FCCSW).
